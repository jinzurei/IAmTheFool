# I Am the Fool 🎭

A solo game jam project exploring modular game design with **Python** and **Pygame**.
Built from scratch as a personal milestone after two semesters back in school.

> "This is me vs. me — and this time, I came to win."

## 🎮 Overview

**I Am the Fool** is a parallax-scrolling endless runner built entirely with rectangles and modular architecture. This prototype is a sandbox to test game development logic, clean structure, and region-based dynamic systems.

- 🌀 Parallax background and scrolling ground
- 🧍‍♂️ Player controls with WASD and dash physics
- 💥 Collision detection
- 🗺️ Region transitions every 2000px (theme cycling)

All logic is built in modules:
```bash
entities/      # game objects like Player, Obstacle, Ground
core/          # settings, main game loop, utils
assets/
```
