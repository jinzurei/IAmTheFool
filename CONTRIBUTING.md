# Contributing to Endless Runner

🛠️ This project was created as a personal challenge during a solo game jam — a way to test and reflect on my skills after two semesters back in school.

While active development is personal, contributions are welcome **for those interested in reviewing my code, providing feedback, or exploring collaboration opportunities.**

## 📬 How to Engage

1. **Fork this repo** *(optional)* to explore ideas or experiment.
2. **Open an Issue** if you'd like to:
   - Offer code review
   - Discuss implementation patterns
   - Get in touch about potential collaborations
3. **Pull requests** are accepted after discussion.

## 💡 What I Appreciate

- Constructive feedback
- Thoughtful code reviews
- Suggestions on clean architecture or design

## 🚫 Not Accepting Right Now

- Feature additions without discussion
- Major rewrites
- Full gameplay expansions

## 🧱 Code Style

- Follow Python PEP8
- Emphasize readability and modular structure (`core/`, `entities/`, `assets/`)
- Use functions and files with single responsibilities

## 🙏 Thank You

Thanks for taking interest in my work! If you're curious about collaborating, mentoring, or reviewing — this repo is open for that purpose.
